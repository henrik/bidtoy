# Bid toy

See it: <http://bidtoy.herokuapp.com>

Playing with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org). This toy app is for bidding on an auction, since I work for an auction site.

## Development

Uses Sinatra (a Ruby framework).

    bundle
    rackup
    open http://localhost:9292

## Tests

No tests yet! Ha. But see [issue #2](https://github.com/henrik/bidtoy/issues/2).
